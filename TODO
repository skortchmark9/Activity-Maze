Heyyyyy Sam - I'm writing this instead of an email wowwwwwww.

We're gonna keep track of stuff we need to do in this file.

Assuming all of the code I wrote works, (which it won't) the biggest obstacle
is refactoring the solver code towards statelessness. In the C - version, the
maze traversal was written to a file (addToList) and then the gui animated that
file. We can't quite do that here because we want the user to be able to
intervene. I've marked the spot where that should happen, but I don't know 
rigorously if we can resume the search at any point. I think we should, but not
sure.

We also talked about registering frustration with dead ends.


Sam,
There are two reasonable options for rendering the tiles. One being create all
possible tiles (I think 16 possibilities). The other being to generate them
at runtime. Do you have a preference?

My idea is to have each room on a 3x3 grid. Something like this:
XOX XXX
OOO OOX
XOX XOX

XOX XOX
XOO OOO
XXX XXX
